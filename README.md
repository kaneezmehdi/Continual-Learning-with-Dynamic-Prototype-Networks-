# Continual-Learning-with-Dynamic-Prototype-Networks-
Exploration of sequential learning on CIFAR-10 using prototype-based classification and ResNet-152 feature extraction. Implemented continual learning across multiple datasets, addressing catastrophic forgetting and domain shifts through prototype adaptation and fine-tuning.
